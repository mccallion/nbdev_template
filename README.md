nbdev is an awesome project by Jeremey Howard. I'm following this along so I can learn Python, machine learning, and software development all at the same time. Becuase why not? Seems like a good idea. Here are the steps for installing my project, which has the horrible idiotic name of nbdev_template.

## 1 Install

Run: `pip install your_project_name`

## 2 How to use

Let's see this at work:

```python
say_hello("Joe")
```




    'Hello Joe!'



```python
say_hello("Rory")
```




    'Hello Rory!'
